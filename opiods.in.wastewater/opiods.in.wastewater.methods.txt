All the standards were purchased from Cerilliant (Round Rock, TX) (Table 1). SPE cartridges, Oasis HLB 6cc (200 mg sorbent, 30 µm particle size) were purchased from Waters (Milford, MA). 

Samples were centrifuged at 3000 g x 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatants were filtered through 0.45 µm syringe filter to collect about 35 mL of filtrates, which then were stored at -20°C until analysis. Samples were concentrated 350 times by SPE cleanup. Briefly, the SPE cartridge was first conditioned with 6 mL of methanol, followed by 6 mL of water. Then 35 mL of sample spiked with internal standards was applied to the cartridge. The sample tube was rinsed twice with 3 mL of water, and the rinsate was applied to the cartridge. Then the cartridge was centrifuged at 3000 g x 10 min at 4°C, followed by vacuum drying for 15 min to remove the water. The dried cartridge was then washed with 12 mL of methanol, and the eluant was collected and dried under nitrogen. The dried extract was resuspended in 0.1 mL of 80% methanol in water, of which 10 µL was transferred to a new vial containing 90 µL of water. The test samples were prepared in four replicates to serve as quality control (QC). Internal standard mix I contained 18 of stable isotopically labeled standards (50 ng/mL in 50% methanol) as shown in Table 1. Internal standard II contained THC-d3 only, 1000 ng/mL in 80% methanol. To each sample, 100 µL of internal standard mix I and 20 µL of internal standard II were added.   
UPLC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Waters Acquity Classic UPLC coupled to a Waters Xevo TQ-S triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Chromatographic separations were carried out on a Waters Acquity HSS T3 column (2.1 x 50 mm, 1.7 µM). Mobile phases were (A) water with 0.1% formic acid and (B) acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. The LC gradient was as follows: time = 0 min, 1% B; time = 0.5 min, 1% B; time = 3.6 min, 60% B; time = 3.7 min, 99% B; time= 6.1 min, 99% B; time =6.15 min, 1% B, time =8.5 min, 1% B. Flow rate was 0.5 mL/min and injection volume was 2 µL. Samples were held at 6°C in the autosampler, and the column was operated at 45°C. Mass detector was operated in ESI+ mode. The capillary voltage set to 0.7 kV.  Inter-channel delay was set to 3 msec. Source temperature was 150°C and desolvation gas (nitrogen) temperature 450°C. Desolvation gas flow was 1000 L/h, cone gas flow was 150 L/h, and collision gas (argon) flow was 0.15 mL/min. Nebulizer pressure (nitrogen) was set to 7 Bar. The MS acquisition functions were scheduled by retention time. Autodwell feature was set for each function and dwell time was calculated by Masslynx software (Waters) to achieve >12 points-across-peak as the minimum data points per peak.
